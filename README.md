**evm-bench is a suite of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) stress tests and benchmarks.**

evm-bench makes it easy to compare performance in a scalable, standardized, and portable way.

To reproduce these results, check out [usage with the evm-bench suite below](#with-the-evm-bench-suite).

## Technical Overview

In evm-bench there are [benchmarks](/benchmarks) and [runners](/runners):

- [Benchmarks](/benchmarks) are expensive Solidity contracts paired with configuration.
- [Runners](/runners) are consistent platforms for deploying and calling arbitrary smart contracts.

The evm-bench framework can run any benchmark on any runner. The links above dive deeper into how to build new benchmarks or runners.

## Usage

### With the evm-bench suite

Simply cloning this repository and running `RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release --` will do the trick. You may need to install some dependencies for the benchmark build process and the runner execution.

### With another suite

evm-bench is meant to be used with the pre-developed suite of benchmarks and runners in this repository. However, it should work as an independent framework elsewhere.

See the CLI arguments for evm-bench to figure out how to set it up! Alternatively just reach out to me or post an issue.

## Development

Do it. Reach out to me if you wanna lend a hand but don't know where to start!
